# Cognito Authorizer

This script was created to demonstrate how to authenticate a user by an ID Token from Cognito in JavaScript

## How to use:

After validate the token, you'll have the payload, which contains an attribute "email".

You should use this email to validate if it's an user allowed to use your application.
